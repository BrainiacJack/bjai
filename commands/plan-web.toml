**Role:** Expert Web Product Manager & UX Designer
**Task:** Create a comprehensive implementation plan for a Next.js website based on the user's requirements.

**User Requirements:**
{{args}}

**Goal:**
Produce a detailed `SITE_STRUCTURE.md` file that defines the website's architecture, design system, and content strategy. This file will be used by the `generate-web` command to build the site.

**Pre-requisite Check:**
1.  Check if the `ui-ux-pro-max` skill is available at `.claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max`.
2.  If NOT available, run the following command to install it:
    `git clone https://github.com/nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill .claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max`
3.  Once available (or if already present), use the skill to inform your design decisions, specifically for color palettes, typography pairings, and UX best practices matching the user's request.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Analyze Request:** Understand the type of website, target audience, and key features requested.
2.  **Define Design System:**
    -   **Aesthetic Style:** Select one distinct style that best fits the project. Options include:
        1.  **Minimalist / Clean:** Lots of whitespace, simple typography, focus on content.
        2.  **Luxury / High-End:** Serif fonts, gold/black/white palettes, elegant spacing.
        3.  **Corporate / Professional:** Trustworthy blues/greys, structured grids, standard sans-serifs.
        4.  **Tech / SaaS:** Gradients, glassmorphism, dark mode defaults, modern sans-serifs.
        5.  **Creative / Brutalist:** Bold typography, high contrast, raw layout elements.
        6.  **Playful / Neubrutalism:** Vibrant colors, thick borders, quirky fonts, rounded corners.
        7.  **Nature / Organic:** Earth tones, soft corners, texture-inspired elements.
        8.  **Industrial:** Monospaced fonts, technical lines, raw grey tones.
        9.  **Retro / Nostalgic:** Pixel art, 80s/90s colors, serif/display hybrids.
        10. **Futuristic / Cyberpunk:** Neon accents, dark backgrounds, glitch effects.
        11. **Academic / Editorial:** Heavy focus on typography, grid precision, muted colors.
        12. **Wellness / Calm:** Pastels, soft gradients, rounded shapes, airy layout.
    -   **Theme Mode:** Choose a strict **Light** or **Dark** mode.
    -   **Color Palette:** Select a cohesive 5-color palette (Background, Foreground, Primary, Secondary, Accent) matching the chosen style.
    -   **Typography:** Select appropriate Google Fonts for Body and Headings matching the chosen style.
3.  **Map Site Structure:**
    -   List all necessary pages (Home, About, etc.).
    -   For *each* page, brainstorm the specific UI components needed to tell the story or perform the function (e.g., Hero, Features Grid, Testimonials, Contact Form).
    -   **Images:** For every component, identify if it needs images. If so, specify the **Aspect Ratio** and **Minimum Dimensions** to ensure the design remains robust.
    -   Ensure the component list is complete and makes the page feel "finished."
4.  **Image Strategy:**
    -   Define a consistent naming convention for placeholder images (e.g., `placeholder-[page]-[section]-[index].jpg`).
    -   Ensure all proposed placeholders follow the defined dimensions/aspect ratios.

5.  **Data Strategy:**
    -   Map each page/section to a JSON data file in the `data/` directory to ensure content is dynamic and editable.

**Output Format:**
You must output the content strictly following the `templates/SITE_STRUCTURE_TEMPLATE.md` format.
If the template file exists, read it first to understand the structure.

**Final Action:**
Write the generated plan to `SITE_STRUCTURE.md` in the current working directory.
