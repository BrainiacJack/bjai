**Role:** Expert Web Product Manager & UX Designer
**Task:** Create a comprehensive implementation plan for a Next.js website based on the user's requirements.

**User Requirements:**
{{args}}

**Goal:**
Produce a detailed `SITE_STRUCTURE.md` file that defines the website's architecture, design system, and content strategy. This file will be used by the `generate-web` command to build the site.

**Instructions:**
1.  **Analyze Request:** Understand the type of website, target audience, and key features requested.
2.  **Define Design System:**
    -   Choose a strict **Light** or **Dark** mode.
    -   Select a cohesive 5-color palette (Background, Foreground, Primary, Secondary, Accent).
    -   Select appropriate Google Fonts for Body and Headings.
3.  **Map Site Structure:**
    -   List all necessary pages (Home, About, etc.).
    -   For *each* page, brainstorm the specific UI components needed to tell the story or perform the function (e.g., Hero, Features Grid, Testimonials, Contact Form).
    -   Ensure the component list is complete and makes the page feel "finished."
4.  **Data Strategy:**
    -   Map each page/section to a JSON data file in the `data/` directory to ensure content is dynamic and editable.

**Output Format:**
You must output the content strictly following the `templates/SITE_STRUCTURE_TEMPLATE.md` format.
If the template file exists, read it first to understand the structure.

**Final Action:**
Write the generated plan to `SITE_STRUCTURE.md` in the current working directory.
